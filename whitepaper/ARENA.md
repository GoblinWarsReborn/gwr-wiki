# Materials and Equipment

Materials are **fungible**, where other players can have an equal.\
The **equipment is not fungible**, it is **unique and exclusive** to each player. 🧰⚔️

🛡️ **Soulbound Equipments:**\
Weapons and armor can only be **equipped once**, and once equipped, they will be **soulbound**. 🔒\
They can be improved by enhancing or including **enchantments**, **gems**, **enchanted gems**, or **sharpening items**. 💎✨🧪\
The **better the item**, the **harder it is to improve it**. ⚙️⬆️

### ⚔️ Crafting - Combat

In fact, **attributes will have no importance in combat** – they will only determine **which items your Goblin can and cannot use**. 🎯

🧠🛡️ **Weapons and armor define success or failure in combat.**
