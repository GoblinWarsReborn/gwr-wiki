# Breeding

Each player starts with one goblin, having to define really early what will be the role it will suit. 🎭 Defining that path wisely is really important to achieve faster evolution in the game. 🚀

As a launch strategy, we will distribute some genesis goblins, that are pure breeds of their lairs, having those no recessive genes. 🧪🧬

Goblins can spawn offspring that can inherit the traits. It occurs as follows:

* 🎯 27% chance of getting the father's trait;
* 🎯 27% chance of getting the mother's trait;
* 🧓 11% chance of getting the paternal grandfather's recessive trait;
* 👵 11% chance of getting the paternal grandmother's recessive trait;
* 🧓 11% chance of getting the maternal grandfather's recessive trait;
* 👵 11% chance of getting the maternal grandmother's recessive trait;
* 🧬 02% chance of mutation.

It is not possible to choose which genes they will inherit, but to calculate the probability of acquiring certain characteristics. 🔢

⚠️ Remember that creating new descendants will have a cost in **GOBI** for each parent.\
This means that creating a new Goblin involves not only investing your GOBIs. For each child the goblin already has, cost increases. 📈

After breed, parents and child will have a **5 day cooldown** and will not be able to perform any other actions. 💤⏳

#### 🎖️ Rarity Calculation

To calculate the rarity of the breed, you must take the rarity of the two goblins, use the following score:

* 🟤 Common → `0 pts`
* 🟠 Uncommon → `1 pt`
* 🔵 Rare → `2 pts`
* 🟣 Epic → `3 pts`
* 🟡 Legendary → `4 pts`

📊 You must calculate the rarity of the two goblins and divide by two, rounding **down**.

**Result:**

* **1 or less** → Gobox Common
* **2** → Gobox Uncommon
* **3 or more** → Gobox Rare

💡 *Example:* If you breed a Legendary (4pts) with a Common (0pts):\
`4 + 0 = 4`, divided by 2 = `2` → Result: **Gobox Uncommon**
