# Crafting Mode

### 🛠️ Crafting Mode: O Modo de Criação

Crafting mode is a set of interactions in which players manipulate materials to create a new item or object from pre-set resources. 🧪🔧

Resources can be consumed or transformed in the creation process, and strategic choice is essential for survival. ⚖️🔥

🎯 **Objective:**\
Part of the game will have the objective of creating new equipment to overcome new daily challenges and farm more items. ⚔️🎒

🧠 **Skill-Based Crafting:**\
Creating these items requires learnable skills and each Goblin will have a limited number of items.\
To learn the skills, you will need a minimum attribute value per Goblin.\
In other words, to learn mining, the Goblin must have **Level 3 in Strength**. ⛏️💪

🤝 **Team Survival:**\
The focus is to survive as a team, as no Goblin will be self-sufficient. 🧙‍♂️🧝‍♀️🧟‍♂️

🏗️ **Collaborative Workflow:**\
To mine, your Goblin can sell the nuggets to another who will need the **stamina** attribute to melt them into bars. 🔩🔥\
But to use it as armor, you'll need to sell to other Goblins with more **intelligence**. 🧠🛡️\

### 🌍 Value Creation & Trade System

The game allows users to handle the entire value creation process from **resource farming**, passing by **crafting special items**, to **selling them on the marketplace**. 🌾⚒️🏪\
Items produced can be **equipped** or **sold to other players** looking for equipment. 🧤🛒

🔒 **Soul-Bound Mechanics:**\
Mods and special items will be **soul-bound** and therefore **not transferable** to other characters. 🔗🚫\
These elements **can be removed** from a character if the player wants, **but it will be wasted** – all the **investment of time and tokens will be lost**. ⏳💸

🧠 **Strategic Decision:**\
This mechanic is a good option **only when rare opportunities** present themselves. 🎯🌟
