# Fusion

You can **fuse two goblins of equal rarity** to generate one of **higher rarity**. ⚗️

⚠️ **Two goblins will be burned**, all their progress will be lost, and all linked items will be **destroyed**.\
The new goblin will have a **higher rarity level** and will keep **characteristics of the main one**, but will pick up **color mix of both**. 🎨
