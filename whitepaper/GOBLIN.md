# Goblin

Goblins are originally from 🔹 **6 different lairs**, which at genesis were considered to be **pure species**.\
Although goblins breeding might occur from different species, there will always be a **dominant species** after miscegenation occurs, as explained later on. 🧪👽

🗺️ Wild goblins are scattered around the world and are often **captured and imprisoned** in **GOBOX**. 📦🪤

✨ Have distinct rarities. They are:

* ⚪ Common
* 🟢 Uncommon
* 🔵 Rare
* 🟣 Epic
* 🟡 Legendary

### 🧠 Increasing your Horde

Once you reunite the necessary resources to acquire a second goblin and start breeding your own army, you'll be able to **increase your horde of Goblins**. 🧟‍♂️🧟‍♀️

#### 🎯 With more creatures you get great advantages:

* 🧩 Goblins have **complimentary attributes and professions**, enabling **quests and battles** available only when they **team up**;
* ⏱️ The more goblins you have, the **more simultaneous achievements** you get, **advancing in the game** and **returning value to your invested time faster**;
* 🛡️ Harder missions demand a **bigger, better trained and equipped horde**.\
  Also, it returns **better loot and resources**;
* 🧬 With more than one Goblin you can get to the **breeding business** to **improve their genetics** and make them unique, to **sell them for the optional value** or to **use your new goblins to gather more tokens**. 💰

#### 📈 Horde Limits & Breeding Rules

There’s **no limit** to the amount of goblins one can have in their own horde,\
but goblins are **monogamous** 💍 and each mate can generate up to **7 children** 👶.

A couple can be **split apart** when one of the mates is **sold**.\
Whenever that happens, there’s a **time-out / cool-down period** when that goblin **won’t be able to breed another one**. ⏳🚫
