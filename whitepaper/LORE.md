### 🧛‍♂️ From Humans to Goblins

⚔️ *Initially using humans, who started to refuse taking place on further destruction of the land, warlords changed their games and started enlisting goblin minions — after all, what other warlike creature has more potential for greed and destruction than goblins?*

⛏️ *Hard-working by nature (no judgments about their nature and goals here, ok?) this species is capable of mastering battleground, resource farming and crafting skills — making them the most natural supporters of mages.*

### 🧬 Goblins: Paths of Potential

🔮 *Each goblin represents an unexplored path full of variables and potential.*\
🎲 *Will your newest goblin master battle skills, be a harvester of resources, crafter or trader?*\
🧭 *That's up to genetics and the way you will guide it.*
