# Rarity

### 🧬 Goblin Rarities

Goblins are divided into distinct realities. They are:

* ⚪ **Common**
* 🟢 **Uncommon**
* 🔵 **Rare**
* 🟣 **Epic**
* 🟡 **Legendary**

🌀 **Rarity is always generated randomly.**\
For example, if you breed two rare goblins, the offspring will **not necessarily be a rare one**.

#### ⚔️ Power Ratio

* **Common** x1
* **Uncommon** x2
* **Rare** x4
* **Epic** x8
* **Legendary** x16

🔁 Rarity will influence **all game modes**.\
In **combat modes**, rarity **will not influence the combat itself**, only other factors — including the **reward in case of victory**. 🏆

#### 🎁 GOBOX Randomness

On **GOBOX**, randomness varies according to the **rarity of the box itself**. 📦✨
