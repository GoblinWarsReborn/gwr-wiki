## 🌐 Cordis: More Than a Game — A Living Universe

Relies on fishing rods made from wood obtained in the mining and woodcutting game, and special lines crafted by weavers.

#### 🪵 **Mining & Woodcutting Game**

Supplies key resources like wood, ores, gemstones, and metals, which are fundamental for crafting tools, gear, and equipment in all games.

#### 💍 **Accessory Crafting Game**

Where players create rings, earrings, bracelets, and anklets that grant buffs and abilities usable across all Cordis games.
