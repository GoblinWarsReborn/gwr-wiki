Combat systems will basically be based on **range**, **movement**, **defense** and **health**. 🎯🛡️💥

#### 🧭 Movement:

* Every Goblin will have the action to **move one space forward or backward**.
* Movement involves **trading places with an ally**. 🔄👣

#### ❤️ Health & 🛡️ Shield:

* **Health** is based on your **Stamina** with equipment modifications.\
  It can **only be recovered with healing** of some kind. ❤️‍🩹
* **Shield** has a **fixed value**, based on armor.\
  It is **regenerated every turn**. When it runs out, the Goblin starts **losing health**.\
  Shield can be increased during a turn with **defense skills**. 🛡️🔋

***

#### 🎮 Actions in Combat:

Actions are defined by a **mix of attributes**, **skills**, and **weapons**.

* Example: A Goblin with **high intelligence** can learn a **fire school spell**.\
  If he has a **staff**, he can cast **Fire Rain**, dealing **area damage to 3 enemies**. 🔥🌧️

#### 🧱 Weapon Mechanics:

Weapons will have **different ranges and actions**:

* 🗡️ **Sword**: Hits the enemy directly in front.
* 🪓 **Spear**: Hits **two spaces ahead**.
* 🏹 **Bow**: Hits the **fourth square**, ignoring enemies before.

Weapons can deal **different types of damage** to **shield** or **health**:

* ⚔️ **Swords**: Deal normal damage.
* 🔨 **Maces**: Double **shield damage**, half **health**.
* 🔪 **Knives**: Half **shield damage**, double **health**.

***

#### 🕒 Attack Order:

* Defined by a mix of the **Agility attribute** ➕ **armor weight reduction** ➕ **turn-based buffs or debuffs**. ⚖️⚡🪶

***

#### 🧟‍♂️ Death Mechanics:

* When an enemy **dies**, the **body will hinder movement** until it is destroyed. 💀🚧

***

### ⚔️🏆 PVP: Player vs Player

PVP battles are a **shorter path to wealth and reputation**. 💰🌟\
Our battling system operates with **automatic leveled matchmaking**, ensuring fairness:

* The **first-in-rank Goblin** from **Player A** fights the **first-in-rank Goblin** from **Player B**, and so on. ⚖️🎯

🚨 **Beware!**\
Side effects such as **damage taken**, **lost resources**, etc., are **greater for the loser** and **recovery time is longer** than with quests. ⛑️🧾
