# Goblin Hero Soul

**Goblin Hero Soul (GOBI)** is a **governance token**, whose holders can vote, basically as they had a share of the business.

#### 🎯 Owning GOBIs you will:

* 💰 Be part of **profit sharing** referring to **5% of the transactional fees** on the sale of Goblins and in-game items when tokens dedicated to staking run out;
* 📈 *(For those who keep their GOBIs in Stake)* Get a **proportional percentage** to the new GOBI generated through that stake;
* 🗳️ **Right to vote** on the course of the game;
* 🔥 All GOBIs spent creating new Goblins will be **destroyed**, making the currency even **scarcer**, therefore **increasing its value**.

These mechanisms are intended to **reward players** for interacting with **Goblin Wars** and at the same time **encourage them to keep their tokens** so they can claim **additional rewards**. 🎮🏆
