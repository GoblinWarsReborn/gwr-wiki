# Gold

**Gold** is the **primary in-game currency** used in Goblin Wars. 💰 It is **not a blockchain token**, but rather a centralized currency exclusive to the game's internal economy.

#### 🏞️ How to Earn Gold

You can earn Gold through various in-game activities such as:

* 🧭 Completing **quests** and **adventures**;
* 🛡️ Participating in **missions** and **combat scenarios**;
* ⛏️ **Mining**, **gathering** and **harvesting** raw materials;
* 🏪 **Selling resources** and materials in the **marketing place** to other players.

#### 🧱 What Is Gold Used For?

Gold is essential for several aspects of gameplay, including:

* ⚒️ **Crafting items** and upgrading equipment;
* 🛠️ **Repairing gear** damaged in battles or long missions;
* 🧪 **Buying consumables**, healing items or temporary buffs;
* 🧾 **Paying fees** for certain horde management activities or minor services;

#### 🚫 Not a Token

Gold is crucial for managing your horde efficiently and sustaining long-term gameplay without depending solely on external investments. ⚔️🌿
