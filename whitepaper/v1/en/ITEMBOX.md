# Item Box

**ItemBox** are **NFTs**, non-fungible tokens, contract type **ERC721** (Previously it was ERC1155, but some external marketing places do not support this format). 🔄

These boxes will only be created by players using the **crafting system** or as a **reward**, they can be sold in the game's **marketing place** or externally *(temporarily only in the game's marketing place)*.

🛠️ Once the **crafting system** is available, a **durability system** will be added to items. If they break, they can be repaired through crafting.
