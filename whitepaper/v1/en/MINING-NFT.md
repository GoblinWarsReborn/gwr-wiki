# Mining & NFT Marketplace Integration

In the **Goblin Metaverse**, players can mine a variety of materials:

The rarer the material, the harder it is to find — but also more valuable! 💰

***

### 🔥 **NFT Transformation**

Once materials are mined, players can:

✅ Convert 🪙 **rare materials into NFTs**\
✅ List them on the marketplace\
✅ Trade, sell, or use them in **partnered games**

> 🌀 Your hard work in Goblin Wars can transcend worlds!

***

### 💥 **Scarcity & Burning Mechanism**

To maintain the balance of the economy:

♻️ **Materials used in crafting are burned** — permanently removed from circulation.\
This generates **natural scarcity** and keeps the value of NFTs growing over time.

#### 🔥 **Burn-to-Value Formula:**

* The more players craft ➡️ the more materials are burned 🔥
* Scarcity increases 📈
* Item value appreciates 💎

***

### 🌐 **Cross-Game Utility**

Your NFTs aren’t locked to Goblin Wars:

🚪✨ **Use them in partnered games across the metaverse**\
💼 Trade them in open marketplaces\
⚔️ Apply them to quests, battles, or crafting in other ecosystems

The Goblin economy is powered by:

* ⚒️ **Mining**
* 🏭 **Crafting & Burning**
* 💹 **Supply & Demand**
* 🌍 **Cross-game interoperability**

> 💎 **Scarcity creates value. Value drives the economy. The economy empowers the players.**
