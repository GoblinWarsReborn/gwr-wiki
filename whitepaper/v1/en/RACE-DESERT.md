### Desert Goblins

Desert goblins are reddish nomads that carry the reptilian trait. 🦎 They are able to face great battles and survive extreme conditions due to their ability to adapt. 🔥⚔️

They don't have a lot of physical strength and that makes them very agile. 🏃‍♂️💨 They have heightened senses but are shy. 👀🤫

Originals have reddish skin, yellow snake-like eyes and orange hair. 🟥👁️🟧
