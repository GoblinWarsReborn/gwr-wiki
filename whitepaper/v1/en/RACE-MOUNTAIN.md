### Mountain Goblins

Mountain Goblins are reddish creatures with angry eyes and use too much brutality. 🔴😠💢

As they are highlanders, they have developed survival skills such as endurance. 🗻💪🛡️

Due to the robustness of their skin they are strong and vigorous. Despite their brute nature, they are unintelligent and charismatic. 🧱🔥😅✨
