# Races

Each Goblin has particular characteristics and attributes, with up to 6 distinct races that can be bred to generate new Goblins. 👾🐾

It is not possible to choose which genes they will inherit. That is calculated by our genetic algorithm and it's sophisticated rules. 🧪🧠

Despite the multiple characteristics each goblin has, the dominant genetics will define its species. 🧬✨ From that species a series attributes and professional bonus will be calculated and displayed to the user when the time to create and improve the goblin comes. 📊⚔️
